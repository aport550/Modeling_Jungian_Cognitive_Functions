I always had an interest in "pure" mathematics relative to "applied." I just enjoyed solving proofs in a unique original way instead of resorting to sources of information to attain the answer. I liked how there were multiple ways to arrive at a sound conclusion. On one instance, I created a way to solve a typology problem prior to a midterm and ended up using it on the exam, which I knew was a risk. I also tried solving the "Goldbach conjecture" as a mathematics major, and spent an entire week trying to tackle it. My mom mentioned that I was very insensitive during that period. I never intended to be, however, I was very unaware of my environment at the time. I ended up creating some algorithm to solve for the set of all non-prime integers. I also created many "non practical" equations during that time, one of which was vedic multiplication. Lately, I have been doubtful of my type...I always obtain "INTP" for my result, however, I am quite indecisive regarding my preferences. I have narrowed down the possibilities to either INTP, ISTP, or ISTJ. Also, I am quite adept at making predictions based on patterns/trends and due tend to have emotional outbreaks at times. I also tend to ignore females if they get emotionally "close" to me.
